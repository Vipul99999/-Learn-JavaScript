/* Is javascript static or dynamicaly typed langauge?

// Ans => Dynamicaly typed langauge

In dynamically typed languages, like JavaScript, 
the type of a variable is set dynamically during code execution.
 For example:
let a = "abc"; // 'a' is a string
a = 10; // 'a' becomes a number

In JavaScript, 
you can assign values to variables without specifying their type. 
The type is determined based on the assigned value. 
This dynamic behavior allows flexibility 
but can also lead to potential errors.


JavaScriptâ€™s Dynamism:

JavaScript is considered dynamic because:
Variables: All variables are dynamic in type and existence.
 You can create new variables at runtime.

Code: Even the code itself is dynamic.
 You can modify it during execution.

While this dynamism simplifies variable assignment,
 it can also introduce errors. For instance, 
 if you define a variable to hold numbers 
 and later accidentally change its value to null or a string, 
 it could lead to unexpected behavior.
